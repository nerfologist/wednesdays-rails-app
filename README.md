# Simple custom Shopify App developed with Rails/shopify_app
- `git checkout step-0`: initial state (clean Rails app with no additional gems)
- `git checkout step-1`: we have installed and configured the dotenv-rails and shopify_app gems
- `git checkout step-2`: the app registers a `products/update` HTTP webhook
- `git checkout step-3`: in response to a product update, the app sets a tag
